# Current-Date-and-Time-Project

# Date and Time Display Project

This project is a simple web page that displays the current date and time using JavaScript and Bootstrap. The time updates every second, and the page is styled with Bootstrap components.

## Features

- Displays the current date and time.
- Responsive design with a navigation bar and jumbotron.
- Styled with Bootstrap 5.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Bootstrap 5)
- JavaScript

## How It Works

The JavaScript code uses the `setInterval()` function to update the displayed time every second. The `Date` object is used to fetch the current time and date, which is then displayed in the jumbotron.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/date-time-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd date-time-project
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the page.

## Usage

You can modify the background color, styling, and content by editing the `index.html` and `styles.css` files.
